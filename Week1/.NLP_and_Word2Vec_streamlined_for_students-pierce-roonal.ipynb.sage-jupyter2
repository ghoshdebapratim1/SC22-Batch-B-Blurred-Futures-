industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends.', 'present-day volcanic co emissions are equivalent to less than % of current anthropogenic co emissions.', 'the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by self-reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedbacks.', 'the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.', \"the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature.\", 'in addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of co on plant growth.', 'uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.', 'as the air is warmed by greenhouse gases, it can hold more moisture.', 'water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, so this further heats the atmosphere.', 'if cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet.', 'if clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet.', 'the effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty.', \"another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the earth's surface.\", \"more of the sun's energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of arctic temperature changes.\", 'arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and co into the atmosphere.', 'climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems.', 'overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive.', 'around half of human-caused co emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans.', 'on land, elevated co and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth.', 'climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future.', 'soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up.', 'as more co and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon.', 'overall, at higher co concentrations the earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions.', 'a climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system.', 'models are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks.', \"models also include natural processes like changes

annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.', 'the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.', 'past models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.', 'sea level rise since was underestimated in older models, but
